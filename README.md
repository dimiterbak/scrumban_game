The Scrumban Game is a fun way to practice evolutionary change in the context of software development. The game simulates the notorious and first ever Kanban case study about the XIT team at Microsoft.

In the game you will successfully improve the performance of your Scrum team by applying the Kanban method, while keeping the core Scrum process intact.

Your improvement efforts will go through three sprints:
1)	In the first sprint your goal is to understand and measure what is the current state of the system. 2)	In the second sprint you decide to stop doing estimates and offer a Service Level Expectation (SLE) instead. 3)	In the third sprint you introduce WIP limits and switch to on-demand replenishment of the Sprint backlog.

Playing the game you will learn:

 - How to prepare and make use of Cumulative Flow Diagram (CFD), Customer Lead Time scatter plot, System  - Lead Time histogram, Flow Efficiency, Due Date Performance, SLE performance.
 - How to offer Classes of Service.
 - How to manage the flow of work in your Scrum team.
 - How to visualize your work
 - How to limit work-in-progress (WIP)
 - How to make policies explicit
 - How to Implement feedback loops
 - How to Improve collaboratively, evolve experimentally.
